// groovy can sometimes be refered to as a scripting
// language - but this is a disservice as it is much more than that

println "Hello from myscript.groovy"

// a script is a groovy file that contains groovy
// code outside of a class file
// but it gets compiled into a class file
// body of script copied into a run method
